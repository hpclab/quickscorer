QuickScorer
===========

**QuickScorer** was designed by Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R. with the support of Tiscali S.p.A. 

The QuickScorer algorithm is discussed in *Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R.* **Quickscorer: a fast algorithm to rank documents with additive ensembles of regression trees.** *In SIGIR â€™15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (2015)*.

*Dato, D., Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R.* **Fast Ranking with Additive Ensembles of Oblivious and Non-Oblivious Regression Trees.** *In  ACM Trans. Inf. Syst., 2016 (to appear)* presents an extensive and detailed test assessment on two standard Learning-to-Rank datasets and on a novel very-large dataset we made publicly available for conducting significant efficiency tests ([istella dataset](http://blog.istella.it/istella-learning-to-rank-dataset/)).

**QuickScorer** is undergoing a patent process. Title of invention: **A method to rank documents by a computer, using additive ensembles of regression trees and cache optimization, and search engine using such a method**, applicant *Tiscali S.p.A.*, inventors: *Dato, D., Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R.*, international patent pending no. PCT29914.
